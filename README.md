# Supervised Machine Learning (Classification)
The data set is a collection of 8X8 pixel images with hand written digit and a label for the digit on the image.

I employ supervised machine learning to develop a classification model that is able to predict the hand written image in an 8X8 image.

In addition, an exploratory analysis is conducted to gain more insight on the data set.
